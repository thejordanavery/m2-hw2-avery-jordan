<h2>Career Goals</h2>
<p>I am a first-year graduate student at the University of Florida. I am studying Web Design and Online Communication to seek a career in UX/UI design upon my planned graduation in May 2024. 
</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I was born in Queens, New York in the mid-1990s. I moved to Melbourne, Florida in the mid-2000s. I started my time at the University of Florida in 2017 in the College of Journalism and Communications Advertising program as an undergraduate. During this time, I was named one of the Most Promising Multicultural Advertising Students by the American Advertising Federation and I was a leading member and one of a select group of minorities to win UFâ€™s Fox Sports University cohort where I helped to make some of the creative and strategic efforts for the Super Bowl LIV host committee.

    <p>The pandemic that ensued after these events made me want to change careers. I was not happy with how my career was panning out. It felt like I had no control over how my career was going to go and I wanted out. I am here to change the tides of my career and go into something that moves me.
